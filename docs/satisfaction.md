# Satisfaction

"Voter Satisfaction" is a measure of how well a voting system picks the hypothetical "best winner" based on each candidates numeric utility to each voter. It assumes we can simulate elections reasonably representative of real ones, that voters have perfect knowledge of each candidate and their own utilities for those candidates, and that we can predict what voting strategies those voters might use. Because of these drawbacks we cannot compare these numbers in absolute terms, and will find a range of values for each voting method depending on initial assumptions. Still, it can provide useful context when comparing the relative ranges of different voting methods.


| Method    | Low End | High End |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Consensus | 89 - 91 | 90 - 96  |
| Approval  | 87 - 87 | 89 - 93  |
| IRV       | 80 - 80 | 82 - 89  |
| Plurality | 51 - 68 | 87 - 88  |

In this example, we see that Consensus and Approval voting both are pretty good at selecting optimal candidates -- but even IRV is much better than Plurality.
