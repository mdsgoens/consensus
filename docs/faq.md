## 1. Isn't Consensus Voting just Bucklin Voting[1]?

In Bucklin voting, *all* second-choice votes are added to the tally if the first-choices are insufficient to elect a majority winner. Consensus voting differs in three ways:

1. It only adds votes to the tally when necessary to prevent the election of someone the voter likes less.
2. It is more resistant to "burying" because it is independent of clones one could use to "pad" the choices between one's first and last preferences.
3. It allows voters to rank multiple first-choice preferences, choosing the "best" majority winner when multiple candidates have majority support.
