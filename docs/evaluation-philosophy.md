* Metric to optimize: Voter participation & voter honesty.
* Must be simple enough that voters understand:
  * How to vote.
  * What strategy they should use to optimize their voice (Ideally, "by voting honestly")
  * How to interpret results
  * That the results are "fair"
* How would I personally want to cast my vote?
* Resistance to strategic voting is a primary goal
  * Encourage as much honest voting as possible
  * Minimize regret at casting an honest vote, or regret of casting a suboptimal strategic vote
* Any voting method with academic support is going to select a "reasonable" winner; instead of optimizing for how the winner is selected, optimize for what behaviours the voting system encourages from both candidates and voters.
